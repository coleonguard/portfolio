# Work Experience

While I was getting my BS in Computer Science: Intelligence & Theory at Georgia Tech, I started a geotechnical company called Levitree aimed at land resilience and carbon sequestration. In parallel, I was lucky to spend a couple semesters interning in as a data scientist and machine learning engineer. Otherwise, I was focused on my [research](https://portfolio.colebjohnson.com/research) at Georgia Tech and Caltech.

## Co-Founder & Head of Software Engineering @ <a href="https://www.levitree.com" target="_blank">Levitree</a>

> We are the only solution to elevating terrain without property destruction & are the cheapest carbon sequestration option by an order of magnitude.

- **Dates**: January 2021 - Present
- **Description**: Rising sea levels and subsidence make flooding an increasingly severe threat. Levitree addresses this by injecting slurried wood underground, which hydraulically fractures the land to create an aperture, elevating properties above flood levels. This process also permanently sequesters the carbon stored in the wood. Unlike prohibitively expensive alternatives such as property demolition and rebuilding or sea walls which generally cost hundreds of millions, our method affordably elevates terrain while sequestering carbon at an order of magnitude less than the cost of direct air capture.

## Visiting Research Fellow @ <a href="http://www.bipedalrobotics.com/" target="_blank">Caltech AMBER Lab</a>

> Reinforcement learning for massively parallelized walking controllers & robust safety garauntees using model predictive control.

- **Dates**: April 2024 - August 2024
- **Description**: Check out the two projects I worked on over the summer [here](https://portfolio.colebjohnson.com/research#learning-tube-dynamics-with-massively-parallel-simulation-for-robust-safety-in-practice) and [here](https://portfolio.colebjohnson.com/research#massively-parallelized-reinforcement-learning-for-trajectory-based-controllers). Absolutely loved my time here, probably one of the most learning-dense experiences I've ever had.

## Artificial Intelligence Intern @ <a href="https://www.optimaldynamics.com/" target="_blank">Optimal Dynamics</a>  

> Hierarchical reinforcement learning for planning optimization.

- **Dates**: January 2023 - August 2023
- **Description**: I contributed to multiple projects focused on improving optimization and model reliability. First, I designed a hyperparameter tuner for the primary optimization algorithm, incorporating trucking feedback data for continuous fine-tuning. Second, I developed drift analysis software to monitor prediction accuracy over time, identifying and addressing quality degradation due to anomalies. This system tracked incremental model changes and filtered out harmful data streams to maintain robust performance.

## Machine Learning Intern @ <a href="https://www.honeywell.com/us/en" target="_blank">Honeywell</a>  

> NLP and generative language models to automate workflows.

- **Dates**: January 2022 - May 2022
- **Description**: I implemented generative language models to automate quote generation, standardize product specifications, and recommend optimal purchase options based on past data. I also created entity recognition and document classification tools to parse and categorize order requests.

## Data Analytics Intern @ <a href="https://www.autointel.io/" target="_blank">Automation Intelligence</a>  

> Optimization algorithms for route planning in warehouses.

- **Dates**: August 2021 - December 2021
- **Description**: I implemented numerous different optimization algorithms to create a toolbox for generating routes through warehouses for robots. I additionally designed search algorithms and used principle component analysis to analyze the efficiency of workflows.

## Perception Research Intern @ <a href="https://whitneylab.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Berkeley Whitney Lab</a>  

> Studied human perception through virtual simulations.

- **Dates**: July 2019 - August 2019
- **Description**: Worked on a couple cool projects summer of junior year in high school, one of them was in [serial dependence in radiology](https://github.com/coleonguard/SerialDependenceInRadiology) and the other was in [how temporal elements affect perception of crowds](https://github.com/coleonguard/SerialDependenceInRadiology).
